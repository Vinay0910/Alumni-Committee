                    Annual Alumni Meet is conducted every year on the first Saturday of January which receives an
                    enthusiastic response. It is a time for Alumni to come back to their Alma Mater and relive the

                    This year, the Alumni Committee launched an initiative named “Alumni Speakup” to provide a platform
                    for inviting ex-students to deliver talks to present students on varied technical and Non-technical.
                    This effort was appreciated by the students. AlmaConnect, an Alumni portal is available for current
                    students, staff and alumni to connect to other alumni spread across the world. It’s a great platform
                    to keep everyone connected and updated with latest developments in college.

                  The Alumni Association of Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering, Bandra, Mumbai recently
                  organized an annual alumni meet titled Alumni Meet 2021 on 13th February 2021 at 8:00 pm IST. Due to
                  the prevailing Covid-19 situation and related restrictions the meet was conducted online through the
                  Zoom platform.
                </em>
                <p>The audience consisted of not only our prestigious alumni but also our enthusiastic students. Along
                  with them a group of ex and current professors also attended the meet. Last but not least the meet was
                  also attended by the non-teaching staff of our college. There was a total of 370 attendees at the

               <strong>Objective: </strong> 
                <p> The Alumni Association of Fr. CRCE has worked relentlessly towards being a bridge between the
                  distinguished alumni and students of Fr. CRCE. The Alumni Association aims to build a network of
                  alumni of Fr. CRCE from all over the world. Every year the annual alumni meet is organized to reunite
                  our prestigious alumni and celebrate their spirit. Ever since the conception of the annual alumni
                  meets there has been a complaint from the alumni side of not being able to attend the alumni meet due
                  to their infeasibility to travel from their accommodations. This year the Alumni Association saw a
                  great opportunity to address this issue and decided to conduct the annual alumni meet online. So that
                  alumnus from all over the world could attend the annual alumni meet. Following the tradition this year
                  the batch of 1995, which completed its 25 years of graduation, was felicitated.

                <p> The complete event was divided mainly into three sections. Induction Ceremony, Jubilee Celebration

                  <strong> Event Synopsis:</strong>
                  <br>
                  Despite the prevailing situation due to COVID-19 the Student Alumni Committee of Fr. CRCE
                  managed to conduct an engaging Panel Discussion via Google Meet with keen and curious
                  participants in the audience.

                  The event started with a greeting to all the participants and panelists from the Operations Head
                  and event coordinator of the Student Alumni Committee of Fr. CRCE, Ms. Mareena Fernandes.
                  After brief introductions and formalities, the moderator Mrs. Sayli Potdar kicked off the panel
                  discussion by asking the panelists about a host of different topics including their experiences with
                  building successful startups, the process they followed for generating and incubating ideas and
                  their outlook on the startup culture and challenges faced in an ecosystem like India. The diverse
                  backgrounds of our panelists and their multiple start up ventures served to make the discussion
                  an all-round one with multiple perspectives and ideas shaping the responses of the panelists.
                  Several fundamental concepts such as fund generation, expansion plans etc. were also discussed
                  with participation from students as well as faculty members. The speakers were also determined
                  to mention the mistakes made by them along the way and provided possible solutions and
                  alternatives to avoid making the same errors.
                  <br>
                  <hr>
                  The event ended with a question and answer round where the audience posed their questions
                  before the panel. The panelists patiently answered all the questions ranging from “what is the
                  right time to start a company” to the various methods used to accumulate funds.
                  A formal vote of thanks was delivered by the committee head Mr. Cyril Varghese thanking the
                  panelists and the audience thus concluding the event.
